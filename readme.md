# Enhancing API Secuirty💥

Hi there! 👋  
Welcome to my MSc Cybersecurity thesis project – a deep dive into making REST APIs safer, and more secure for developers and users
---

## 📚 What's This All About?

APIs are the backbone of modern web applications – but they’re also attractive targets for attackers. 
This project tackles the big question:

**"How effective is implementing adaptive rate limiting and honeytoken mechanisms in a secure design framework to mitigate security vulnerabilities in REST APIs for JavaScript web applications?"**

✨ With a sprinkle of smart security tools and good design practices, I aim to:

- Implement **adaptive rate limiting** 🐢⚡ to slow down bad actors and protect performance.
- Deploy **honeytokens** 🍯🎣 to catch attackers red-handed.
- Develop a **secure design framework** tailored for modern web APIs using JavaScript.

## 🧩 What’s Inside?

This thesis project is made up of 3 fun parts:

1. **🎯 Research & Framework Design**  
   Exploring current best practices and crafting a clear, developer-friendly framework for secure API design.

2. **💻 Hands-On Implementation**  
   Building a sample API using **Node.js + Express**, showing real-world examples of:
   - Adaptive rate limiting
   - Honeytoken deployment
   - Secure input validation & authentication flows

3. **🧪 Testing & Evaluation**  
   Using tools like **OWASP ZAP** and **fuzz testing** to evaluate how well the framework defends against common threats.

## 🔒 Cool Features You’ll Love

- 🧠 Adaptive rate limiting that responds based on behavior
- 🕵️‍♀️ Honeytokens that trap unauthorized access attempts
- 🔄 Modular design – plug it into any Node.js project

## 🧠 Goals of the Project

✅ Educate developers on **building secure APIs from the start**  
✅ Reduce reliance on after-the-fact patching 🩹  
✅ Encourage a **“Secure by Design” mindset** in API development  
✅ Contribute a practical, working framework that can be adapted in real-world projects

## 🧁 Final Thoughts

This thesis is not just about security – it’s about **making security accessible and easier to integrate** for developers like you and me!

I hope this work inspires better habits, safer APIs. 💡

Thanks for stopping by – feel free to explore the code, read the paper, and reach out if you have any questions!
